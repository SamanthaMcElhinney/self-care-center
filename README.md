# Self Care Center

### Abstract:
I created a self care app that generates random mantras and affirmations with selecting a receive message feature. This app allows users to select and add their favorite messages and display them in an individualized page that they can reference for future use. This app is meant to be a self-help tool that can be personalized for inspirational ideas.
 
### Installation Instructions:
A user needs to git clone the repo to their local browser. Then they should be able to open the application in visual studio code or whichever editor they are using.
 
### Preview of App:
I added the saved mantras/affirmations page. This is a very useful feature for the user to reference their favorite messages.
 
### Context:
I had to work on this project for approximately 25 hours. I am in my third week of coding. I completed all parts independently for this project.
 
### Contributors:
I was the only creator for this application
 
### Learning Goals:
The learning goals of this project was to utilize HTML, CSS and Javascript for creating a self care application. I gained more experience with CSS and HTML, matching the styling content of the intended page. This project was further meant to develop my understanding of using the DOM, data types, and javascript, along with further gaining knowledge for personalized features.
 
### Wins + Challenges:
A big win was being able to complete the majority of the project independently, prior to needing to reach out for help, due to unproductive struggle with the final challenge to delete messages from a saved page. I was unable to finish this despite nearly 4 hours spent on this one feature with assistance with a classmate for troubleshooting. I still have a lot of work to go with CSS and HTML; however, I was able to utilize dev tools and flex-box some in my project. To overcome problems I reviewed notes, researched MD, pseudocoded, watched youTube videos, and used dev tools/ console log with attempts to find where the code was breaking.
